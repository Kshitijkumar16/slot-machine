I have been noticing I use python mostly for Data Science now or for my Web App backends. 
I wanted to change that so I took up this little project, to create a Slot Machine Simulation, you can run on VS Code.
I have been having fun so far!

                                !!  GRAND CASINO SLOT MACHINE  !!

Rules - 
        1. You first have to deposite an amount of chips upto 3000 max.
        2. You can bet on 1 - 3 lines at a time.
        3. You cannot bet more than 1000 chips and less than 1 chip per line.
        4. The slot machine looks like this -
                 A | D | B      <-- line 1
                 C | C | C      <-- line 2  (a WIN on a line looks like this)
                 D | A | C      <-- line 3
        5. Betting on 1 line means TOP line, betting on two lines means TOP TWO lines.

Good luck!
